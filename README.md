# Travel Tracker

Travel Tracker is a web application that allows users to create an account and keep track of places they have traveled to! Using Google Maps, logged-in users can set markers on specific locations by clicking on that area of the map. A search feature or geolocation can be utilized to locate a desired area on the map. Once the user sets a marker, they are shown a popup window to allow them to provide their marker with a title, date, and description, which can also be updated later on.
